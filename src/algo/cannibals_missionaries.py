Missionaries and Cannibals Problem
----------------------------------

- There are 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on one side of a river.
- They all need to cross to the other side using a boat.
- The boat can carry either 1 or 2 people at a time.
- At no time, on either side of the river, can the number of cannibals
  exceed the number of missionaries â€” unless there are zero missionaries
  on that side.

  (If cannibals outnumber missionaries on a side, the missionaries
  would be eaten.)

Goal:
- Move all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals safely to the other side
  of the river without violating the rules above.
